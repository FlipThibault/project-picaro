Because wererats typically dwell in metropolitan areas where they can hide in plain sight, practically any city goer could be a wererat in disguiseâ€”from the quiet shopkeep to the city's criminal mastermind. The bustle of crowds and countless rat holes make ghettos and shantytowns favored homes for wererats, especially since in these poorer districts the wererat can kill out of greed or fear with little chance of the authorities noticing. In some cities, wererats operate entire thieves' guilds or organized crime rings, and membership requires willfully submitting to the wererat's cursed bite. Wererats look very similar to ratfolk when in hybrid form, apart from potential differences in size, but ratfolk have no love for wererats.\n\nOnce a murderour adventurer, Raszik unfortunately fell victim to the enchanting allure of the many treasures that the Everchanging Labyrinth is renowned for. He ventured in with a party of mercenaries, none ever returned. Now he shulks about in the lower dungeon levels of the Labyrinth, a mindless, ravenous husk of an already dangerous man.\n\nRecall Knowledge - Beast (Arcana, Nature): DC 16\nRecall Knowledge - Humanoid (Society): DC 16\nUnspecific Lore: DC 14\nSpecific Lore: DC 11\n\n**Tactics**\n*Opening Moves* Raszik uses Rat Swarm Summon to overwhelm opponents with additional threats.\n*Combat Strategy* Raszik utilizes Infectious Bite to spread disease and weaken foes, while leveraging Pack Tactics to enhance its attacks.\n*Defense* Raszik relies on Shadowy Escape to avoid damage and Lycanthropic Resilience to recover from injuries.","items":"hand crossbow (20 bolts), leather armor, shortsword","spellattack":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"spelldc":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"savenote":"","creature":"","speed":"25 feet","imgurl":"","spelltype":"","focuspoints":0,"cantriplevel":"","ritualtype":"","rituals":"","spells":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"constant":"","minprof":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"strength":{"value":"2","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"dexterity":{"value":"4","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"constitution":{"value":"3","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intelligence":{"value":"0","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"wisdom":{"value":"1","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"charisma":{"value":"0","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"perception":{"value":"10","benchmark":"moderate","note":"low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"acrobatics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"arcana":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"athletics":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"crafting":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"deception":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"diplomacy":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"intimidation":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"medicine":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"nature":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"occultism":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"performance":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"religion":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"society":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"stealth":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"survival":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"thievery":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"lore":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"lorealt":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":"","name":"lore"},"ac":{"value":"19","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"hp":{"value":"50","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"fortitude":{"value":"8","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"reflex":{"value":"10","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"will":{"value":"6","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"resistance":{"value":"Physical 5 (except silver)","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"weakness":{"value":"Silver 5","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"immunity":{"value":"","benchmark":"moderate","note":""},"roadmap":"","info":"","strikes":[{"id":"_8vu0omurf3g","name":"Bite ","traits":"Agile, Finesse","attack":"11 ","damage":"1d8+4  piercing.
